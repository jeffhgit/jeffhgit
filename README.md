Hi, I’m Jeff.

I'm a cybersecurity professional and I develop mobile/browser games in my spare time. I will be posting some of the more complex scripts from my games here as examples of my work.

I’m interested in continuing to advance my skills as a developer and as a security analyst and engineer.

If you've been referred here please feel free to ask me any questions via email and I'll be happy to provide detail.

Thank you.
